# Case made out of PCBs

This is an alternative to the acrylic case. It has the same dimenssions and form
but it is made out of (more) layers of PCBs instead of acrylic.

## Parts (top to bottom)

1. punk75_inner.zip - PCB - 4 needed - OPTIONAL FOR HI-PRO CASE
2. punk75_plate.zip - PCB
3. punk75_inner.zip - PCB - 5 needed
4. punk75_bottom.zip- PCB

This parts can be sourced from a PCB manufacturer with the .zip files of this
folder.

## Screws and Standoffs

1. x16 M3x6mm screws
2. x8  M3x10mm round standoffs of 5mm outside diameter
    (for the HI-PRO use M3x15mm)

## Assembly

For the assembly of all the parts we need to first place the switches on the
plate and then proceed to solder them to the keyboard PCB (solder first the
rotary encoders to the pcb if any).

Then we can proceed form bottom to top by screwing the spacers to the bottom and
inserting the inners in the standoffs. Notice the inners have breakable zone
where the USB port is placed, this need to be snipped or cut. Cut the needed
amount to fit your cable(is a bit tight, I have on mine 1 not cutted and 4 with
the cutout, test with yours).

Next place the plate and you are good to go.

If you have the HI-PRO place then the rest of the inners (not cutted) and screw
everything.

## Acrylic shield

Additionally two acrylic shields can be used to protect the electronic components.
One, a full shield (shield.dxf) can be used with the HI-PRO case (and with the
LO-PRO if the components are mounted low).

The other option is to use a half shield (half-shield.dxf) that instead of using
the rest of the case as support uses its own standoffs to held it down to the PCB.

This standoffs and screws for the half-shield are M2.5 size, use the lenght you
feel appropiate.
