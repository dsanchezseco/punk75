# Simplier case made out of PCBs

This is an alternative to the full PCB case.
This version has less layers making the whole keyboard lighter, smaller
and cheaper than the full PCB case version.

## Parts (top to bottom)

1. half-shield.dxf          - acrylic
2. punk75_plate_eotw.zip    - PCB #TODO
3. punk75_bottom_eotw.zip   - PCB #TODO

This parts can be sourced from a PCB manufacturer with the .zip files of this
folder.

## Screws and Standoffs

1. x28 M2.5x6mm screws
2. x10 M2.5x?mm standoffs (for case)
3. x4 M2.5x? standoffs (for half-shield)

## Assembly

First screw the standoffs for the case to the underside of the PCB. This is now
easier that when the switches would be in place along with the plate.

Once the 10 standoffs are placed place the switches in the plate and solder them
to the PCB.

Finally place the bottom plate and secure it with its screws

## Acrylic shield

This option uses an smaller acrylic piece to cover the compenents. This half
shield (half-shield.dxf) instead of using the rest of the case as support uses
its own standoffs to held it down to the PCB.

This standoffs and screws for the half-shield are M2.5 size, use the lenght you
feel appropiate. You'll need 4 standoffs and 8 screws.
